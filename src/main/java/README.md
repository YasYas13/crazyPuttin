## Crazy putting

***
### Description

The aim of the project is to create a simulator for putting on sloping greens with obstacles.
The program approximates the physics of real-life putting.
In each game, the player tries to shoot the ball to the target, entering each time the velocity for the ball.


### Instruction

- #### Moving around the scene
  - rotate around the scene using the mouse (click and drag the frame)
  - zoom-in and zoom-out by using the mouse wheel

- #### Playing the game
  - Once the game is loaded, all the values for the game scene are read from the file _inputFile.txt_.
  - On the right panel, we placed two boxes to enter the initial velocity of the ball.
  Fill them in with integer values and press _Hit the ball_ button in order to trigger the ball movement.
  In case the textBoxes were not filled, initial velocity will be read from the file _shot.txt_.
  - Once the ball hits the water, it is respawned at the closest position on the grass field. 
  - You can also shoot the ball with the mouse! Click the ball and drag the mouse to trigger the movement.
